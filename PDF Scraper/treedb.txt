In India, the fruit is regarded as a tonic
for the brain and liver. The flowers are
a rich source of nectar for honeybees
and a sweetened preparation of them
is believed to reduce fever. The seeds
are employed against diarrhoea,
dysentery, diabetes and catarrh and
have an anaesthetic property. The leaf
decoction is applied to sore eyes, also
serves as a diuretic and expectorant
and treatment for rheumatism.
Powdered leaves are rubbed on
the bodies of smallpox patients for
cooling effect. Rose apple wood
makes very good charcoal. A yellow
essential oil, distilled from the leaves,
can be used in the perfume industry.
The bark has been used for tanning
and yields a brown dye. The decoction
of it is administered to relieve asthma
and bronchitis. The root is an effective
remedy for epilepsy.

The wood is mainly used in making
furniture because of its good ability
to undergo carving. Food bowls
and utensils is made out of the
same. It is used to make the thavil,
a Carnatic musical instrument of
South India. Ground up bark is used
to treat skin diseases, dysentery and
haemorrhoids. Leaves are applied to
inflamed and swollen joints. When
cut, the young fruit secretes a yellow
sticky sap used to treat ringworm and
other skin diseases. Roots are used
as a tonic. A yellow dye is obtained
from the flower and fruits, and a red
one from the bark and heartwood.
Other products extracted from the
plant includes tannin, oil and gums (a
dark red resin exudes from the bark).

Ficus benjamina has been shown
to effectively remove gaseous
formaldehyde from indoor air. The
leaves are very sensitive to small
changes in light. When it is turned
around or re-located it reacts by
dropping many of its leaves and
replacing them with new leaves
adapted to the new light intensity.
There are numerous cultivars available
(e.g. ‘Danielle’, ‘Naomi’, ‘Exotica’, and
‘Golden King’). Some cultivars include
different patterns of colouration on
the leaves, ranging from light green

wasp Blastophaga psenes to enter the
fruit and pollinate the flower, where
after the fruit grows seeds. The sap of

Teak is a yellowish brown timber with
good grain and texture. Teak, though
easily worked, can cause severe
blunting on edged tools because of
the presence of silica in the wood.
Teak is often an effective material
for the construction of both indoor
and outdoor furniture. Teak’s high oil
content, high tensile strength and tight
grain makes it particularly suitable
for outdoor furniture applications
and other articles where weather
resistance is desired. Over time teak
can mature to a silvery-grey finish,
especially when exposed to sunlight.
Teak is used extensively in India to
make doors and window frames,

Ptychosperma macarthurii
Macarthur Palm
BACKVagdevi Vilas School, Marathalli Plant No. 82
Very attractive palm with long (2-3m.)
plumose leaves (hence the name
‘Foxtail’), and up to 10m tall with a
grey trunk. It produces large (about
the size of a duck egg) orange fruit.
After it became known to the world, the
Foxtail Palm’s seeds were so highly
sought after that a thriving black
market trade formed. The species
propagates readily in cultivation and
this ultimately reduced the pressure
on the wild population. It has become
widely distributed across the world,
being progressively planted out as
one of the “world’s most popular”
palms.

Foxtail Palm
BACKVagdevi Vilas School, Marathalli Plant No. 83
This very symmetrical plant supports
a crown of shiny, dark green leaves
on a thick shaggy trunk. The trunk
is very low to subterranean in
young plants, but lengthens above
ground with age. The plant is very
slow-growing and requires about
50–100 years to achieve 6-7m of
height. Roots are called coralloid with
an Anabaena symbiosis allowing
nitrogen fixation. The pith contains
edible starch, and is used for
making sago. Before use, the starch
must be carefully washed to leach
out toxins contained in the pith.
